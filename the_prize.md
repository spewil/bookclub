marshall plan -- oil from middle east to economic recovery, containment of communism in asia

saudi oil was critical for saving western oil supplies, good for cold war
saudi king felt "encircled", jordanians iranians etc -- america good ally

italian oil magnate mattei dies in plane crash
tried to break into oil market for italy
coins "7 sisters" oil companies post war

major oil companies powerful enough to set production, set prices. marketed as if they're different but all cooperated in smoked rooms -- kept prices low for western boom (e.g. japanese car production) -- majors claim they had no "real" power like the state

mattei wants slice of crude (no money in filling stations) -- maybe sell government to government (he was a civil servant) -- looks to nasir in egypt

mattei offers nasir 75/25, in the face of usual 50/50 deals. nasir nationalizes suez canal, push out anglofrench suez company.

mattei offers iranian shah 75/25, helps russian build westerly pipeline.

oil is at the control of "invisible minds" rather than invisible hand-- big powers in back rooms rather than the market

1979 shah of iran deposed by ayatollah kumeini == second oil price jump

OPEC meets 1980, broken up after saddam hussein attacks iran to possibly take or destroy iran oil fields -- iran/iraq war 1980

BP discovers oil in Alaska

us and us and russia protect iraq and iran oil assets from each other. truce between iraq and iran. saddam in massive debt from neighbors, kuwait refuses to release debt. iraq invades kuwait. us liberates kuwait because of oil assets

discoveries in permian basis
most oil goes into plastics
siberia is biggest untapped potential?
oil is backbone of current economy
mexican take: "el crudo es el regalo del diablo"
consumer society --> ???
global south focuses on economic growth, industrial north worries about climate
information age means what for future? awareness of a lack of ability to consume. education can be the only answer? for both south and north
economic incentives for renewables, grid networks that are adaptable to electric economy

forbes 2019:
"Those demanding an immediate end to “the oil age” confront the ultimate Catch-22. Any slowdown in U.S. oil production could increase prices, which would bring back more drilling and more production. Any drop in prices would simply encourage more demand while de-incentivizing the use of non-oil energy options."
